# 🎮 ES‑Panels – Comprehensive Controller Test ROM Collection

**ES‑Panels** aims to centralize as many **controller input test ROMs** as possible for emulated systems, serving as the foundation for a future project: a **dynamic arcade-style control panel**.

This repository organizes input test tools (ROMs and homebrew) by system, offering a streamlined way to check button mappings, analog stick behavior, keyboard inputs, and more, directly within **Emulation Station** or other frontends.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a complete, system-by-system archive of **input diagnostic ROMs** across vintage and modern platforms. These ROMs serve as the technical backbone for a **real-time arcade interface** that will visualize controller inputs dynamically, adapting to the active emulator and connected hardware.

---

## 🕹️ Current System Coverage

The project currently includes test ROMs or input utilities for over 40 systems, such as:

- **Home Consoles**: NES, SNES, N64, PSX, PS2, PS3, PSP, GameCube, Wii, Dreamcast, Saturn, Jaguar
- **Portables**: Game Boy (DMG, Color, Advance), Nintendo DS/3DS
- **Computers**: Amiga 500/1200/4000, Atari 2600/5200/7800/800/ST, Apple II, C64/C128, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC
- **Arcade Boards**: CPS1, FBNeo-based systems

Diagnostic tools include the excellent [240p Test Suite](https://github.com/ArtemioUrbina/240pTestSuite) and other homebrew ROMs designed to visualize button presses, analog axis values, and more.

## 🔧 Purpose & Use

These ROMs are used to:

- Verify controller and peripheral input mappings
- Visually confirm analog stick calibration
- Check for latency, drift, or button misfires
- Serve as testing backends for automated input panels

They are especially useful for emulator configuration, frontend integration, arcade cabinet setups, and hardware troubleshooting.

## 🛠️ Long-Term Vision

This project is the **first step toward a dynamic, real-time arcade panel display**, which will:

- Automatically adapt to the system and controller in use
- Show live feedback for every button or stick movement
- Integrate seamlessly with EmulationStation-based builds

The ES‑Panels ROM archive will serve as the core input mapping reference for this interface.

## 📄 Credits

Special thanks to the creators of open-source diagnostic tools, especially **Artemio Urbina** for the [240p Test Suite](https://github.com/ArtemioUrbina/240pTestSuite), which powers many of the console test ROMs in this collection.
